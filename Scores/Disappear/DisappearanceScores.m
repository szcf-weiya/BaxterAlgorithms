function oList = DisappearanceScores(aBlobSeq, aImData)
% Computes scores for events where cells disappear from the image.
%
% The cells can either disappear randomly or migrate out of the field of
% view. In practice, a cell can disappear randomly if it is washed out of
% the field of view during a media change or if it becomes impossible to
% detect due to for example photo bleaching. The score of a disappearance
% event for a cell is the logarithm of the probability that the cell will
% not be present in the following image.
%
% Inputs:
% aBlobSeq - Cell array where element t contains a vector with all Blob
%            objects created through segmentation of frame t.
% aImData - ImageData object for the image sequence.
%
% Important properties in aImData:
% TrackPDisappear - Probability of random disappearance.
% TrackMigInOut - If this is set to true, cells are allowed to migrate out
%                 of the field of view.
% TrackXSpeedStd - The cell speed in pixels per frame. This is used to
%                  compute the probability that a cell migrates out of the
%                  field of view. The cell is assumed to follow a Brownian
%                  motion model where the PDF is an isotropic Gaussian
%                  centered around the position in the previous frame.
%
% Outputs:
% oList - N x 4 matrix, where N is the number of returned disappearance
%         events. The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Image index.
%    oList(:,2) - Index of the detection in image oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3) - Log-probability of the disappearance event NOT occurring.
%    oList(:,4) - Log-probability of the disappearance event occurring.
