function oList = MigLogLikeList_uniformClutter(aBlobSeq, aImData, aMaxArcs)
% Computes migration scores assuming a uniform clutter density.
%
% The function computes the log likelihoods of possible migrations between
% detections (blobs) in consecutive frames. Only the aMaxArcs most likely
% migrations in each direction are returned. This means that the aMaxArcs
% most likely migrations that move from a given detection and the aMaxArcs
% most likely migrations that end in a given detection are returned. A
% migration is only returned once, even if it is among the most likely
% outgoing migrations from one detection and among the most likely incoming
% migrations to another detection.
%
% As a motion model it is assumed that the x-velocity and the y-velocity
% are independent and distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with
% zero mean. The migration probabilities in one time step are assumed to be
% independent of the migration probabilities of other time steps. Clutter
% is assumed to follow a uniform distribution.
%
% Inputs:
% aBlobSeq - Cell array where cell t contains a vector with all Blob
%            objects created through segmentation of frame t.
% aImData - Image data object associated with the image sequence.
% aMaxArcs - The number of outgoing and incoming migrations considered for
%            every detection.
%
% Properties of aImData:
% TrackMotionModel - Name of mat-file with a saved covariance matrix of the
%                    x- and y- displacements from one frame to the next.
%                    Set this to 'none' to use Brownian motion instead.
% TrackXSpeedStd - Standard deviation of Brownian motion in x- and
%                  y-directions. This is used if no motion model has been
%                  defined.
%
% Outputs:
% oList - N x 5 matrix, where N is the number of returned migrations.
%         The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Frame count of the first detection in the migration.
%    oList(:,2) - The index of the detection in image oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3) - The index of the detection in image oList(:,1)+1.
%    oList(:,4) - Log likelihood of the migration NOT occurring.
%    oList(:,5) - Log likelihood of the migration occurring.
