function [oList, oBlobSeq, oPHD] = MigrationScores_generic(aBlobSeq, aImData, varargin)
% Wrapper which computes migration scores using a user specified function.
%
% The function computes scores for possible migrations between blobs in
% consecutive frames. The scores are usually logarithms of posteriori
% probabilities for migrations under specific assumptions. The settings
% associated with the image sequence determine which function is used to
% compute the scores.
%
% Inputs:
% aBlobSeq - Cell array where cell t contains a vector with all Blob
%            objects created through segmentation of frame t.
% aImData - ImageData object associated with the image sequence.
%
% Property/Value inputs:
% CreateOutputFiles - If this parameter is set to true, the functions which
%                     compute the migration scores will not save any files
%                     to disk. Otherwise, some of them will save files in
%                     the resume-directory of the image sequence.
%
% Settings in aImData:
% TrackMigLogLikeList - The name of the function that should be used to
%                       compute the migration scores.
%
% Outputs:
% oList - N x 5 matrix, where N is the number of returned migrations.
%         The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Frame index of the first blob in the migration.
%    oList(:,2) - Index of the detection in image oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3) - Index of the detection in image oList(:,1)+1.
%    oList(:,4) - Score of the migration NOT occurring.
%    oList(:,5) - Score of the migration occurring.
% oBlobSeq - Blobs generated from the Gaussian components of a GM-PHD
%            filter. This output is only used when a GM-PHD filter is used
%            for preprocessing, as in MigLogLikeList_PHD_ISBI_tracks.
% oPHD - Array where each element is a measurement updated GM-PHD for the
%        corresponding time point. This output is only used when a GM-PHD
%        filter is used for preprocessing, as in
%        MigLogLikeList_PHD_ISBI_tracks.
