function oList = CountScores(aBlobSeq, aImData, varargin)
% Computes scores for different cell counts in blobs of an image sequence.
%
% The scores are the log-probabilities of the different cell counts. First,
% a classifier is used to find the probabilities of 0,...,K-1, and K or
% more cells in each blob. Then the likelihoods of K to 9 cells is
% extrapolated from the probability of K or more cells. The extrapolation
% is performed by assuming that the probabilities of different cell counts
% follow a geometric distribution, as described in [1]. The number K is
% usually 2, but depends on the classifier used. Instead of using a
% classifier, one can also specify the settings pCnt0, pCnt1, and pCnt2,
% which define fixed probabilities that a blob has 0, 1, or more than 1
% cell respectively.
%
% Inputs:
% aBlobSeq - Cell array where element t contains a vector with all Blob
%            objects created through segmentation of frame t.
% aImData - Image data object associated with the image sequence.
%
% Property/Value inputs:
% CreateOutputFiles - If this parameter is set to true, the computed list
%                     of scores is saved to a file named counts.mat in the
%                     resume-directory of the image sequence.
%
% Outputs:
% oList- N x 12 matrix where N is the total number of blobs in aBlobSeq.
%        The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Frame index.
%    oList(:,2) - Index of the blob in frame oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3:12) - Log-probability that the blob contains 0 to 9 cells.
