function oList = AppearanceScores(aBlobSeq, aImData)
% Computes scores for events where new cells appear in the image.
%
% The cells can either appear in random places in the image or migrate into
% the field of view. In practice, a cell can appear randomly if it falls
% into focus from suspension or if it is washed into the field of view
% after a media change. The score of an appearance event for a cell is the
% logarithm of the probability that the cell will was not present in the
% previous image.
%
% Inputs:
% aBlobSeq - Cell array where element t contains a vector with all Blob
%            objects created through segmentation of frame t.
% aImData - ImageData object for the image sequence.
%
% Outputs:
% oList - N x 4 matrix, where N is the number of returned appearance
%         events. The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Image index.
%    oList(:,2) - Index of the detection in image oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3) - Log-probability of the appearance event NOT occurring.
%    oList(:,4) - Log-probability of the appearance event occurring.
%
% Important properties in aImData:
% TrackPAppear - Probability of random appearance.
% TrackMigInOut - If this is set to true, cells are allowed to migrate into
%                 the field of view.
% TrackXSpeedStd - The cell speed in pixels per frame. This is used to
%                  compute the probability that a cell has migrated into
%                  the field of view. The cell is assumed to follow a
%                  Brownian motion model where the PDF is an isotropic
%                  Gaussian centered around the position in the previous
%                  frame.
